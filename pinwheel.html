    <h1>Pinwheel!</h1>

    <p>Our cat was named Pinwheel. She was a small, orange,
      and liked to play rought. She was a barn cat and
      lived outside. She slept with the sheep and did a
      great job hunting rodents around our property.
    </p>

    <p>Pinwheel liked to be petted and roll around in your
      lap, but she didn't always have the best manners.
      Sometimes she would suddenly attack the hand that
      was petting her. Her claws were sharp! That's just how
      outside cats are sometimes. Pinwheel sometimes pooped in
      the yard, but other than that she was a good barn cat.
    </p>

    <p>One day Pinwheel disappeared. We miss her. We love you,
      Pinwheel
